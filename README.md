aws_simple_algorithm
==============================

This projects shows the analytics to find out the minimum price update interval for AWS spot instances. With that, it is possible to predict when the next price update is going to happen , thus, just migrating before an instance fails. The result is better availability for instances and reduced costs when using AWS spot instances.
